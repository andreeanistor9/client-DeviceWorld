This is the client side of my application. I used React.js, Material UI, JavaScript and CSS to develop this part.

“Device World” is a web application designed for managing electronic products across different categories. The aim of the project is to develop an intuitive and appealing platform for users, where they can purchase and view electronic products, while the administrator has access to additional functionalities for product and user management.

Through the application, users can create accounts and authenticate themselves as customers or administrators. Authentication is necessary to access role-specific functionalities. Users can explore a wide range of electronic products and utilize filters to easily find the desired items.

The application includes several key features for users: the shopping cart, wishlist, order history, invoice downloads, and recommendations for other relevant products. Each user can add products to their shopping cart, receive additional product recommendations and place an order if desired, all within the same page. Information about orders is stored separately in an order history page. The wishlist allows users to keep track of products they find interesting for future reference.

For administrators, the application provides tools for product and user management in addition to the functionalities available to customers. They can add new products to the database, view, modify, or delete existing products. Furthermore, administrators can manage users by modifying or deleting user accounts from the database.
